# spireav

**spireav** is a wrapper library to FFmpeg that makes it simple to build complex filter graphs, execute transcoding tasks using them, and monitor progress of the tasks.

## Avid Media Composer Integration

This library natively supports the media file format used by Avid Media Composer, and is capable of remuxing MXF OP-Atom files from an Avid workspace into any output format. The library also has tools for organizing Avid MXF files into tapes and clips by reading the Avid metadata.

## Examples

Several examples of how to use this library are in the `examples` folder.
